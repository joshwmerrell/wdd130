                        <p>I decided to use the content I used because it is based on the theme of the page: My Book of Mormon Journey. I picked the images based on the subject of each page. I used AI and GIMP to stylize images in the creative commons to build my page.</p>

                        <p>There were no issues with communicating with my lead developer on this site. I was able to meet with him every class and communication was focussed and stright to the point.</p>

                        <p>For what I gave my lead developer, he did meet expectations for the site. Though, I didn't finish giving all the content for the child pages of the site, what the lead developer was assigned to, he accomplished what I asked for.</p>

                        <p>I attempted to communicate to my development team twice over email. I was able to communicate with only one of my junior developers simply because he communicated back and was able to speak with him in class. I had no communication with the other because he never communicated back.</p>

                        <p>My experience with managing my site with GitHub was familiar and simple. I have my own website published under the url <a href="https://jmerrell.online/" target="_blank">https://jmerrell.online/</a> under GitHub Pages too, and I had to overcome the challenges that way.</p>

                        <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
                        <p>There wasn't any communication with my team lead. If there was any issues with the pagees I was assigned (about us for both of them), then my lead developer would have reached out. I know that this isn't proactive, but setting up these pages was actually very simple.</p>

                        <p>For each site, I knew what was expected of me because all of the format and content was in the site plan provided by the client.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
                        <p>I wasn't in any communication with the lead developer, so I didn't make any changes to the content or the format given in the site plan.</p>

                        <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
                        <p>There was an issue where even though all the code was updated, the page either wouldn't update when viewing it or the formatting wouldn't be applied. I was able to fix this by going into github site itself, removing all the code in the page, pushing it, and reapplying and repushing the code. This worked.</p>

                        <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
                        <p>The most challenging part of this project was coming up with all the content I had planned for the site I was the client of. I wasn't able to overcome it because and will plan to do a little less next time to prevent this.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
                        <p>What I enjoyed most about this project was creating the pages themselves. I take a sense in the creating of art, and I like to think that each webpage is an art of expression. I also really like problem solving the holes or gaps in the plan that I was given for each site.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
                        <p>What I would do next time is that I would have all the content prepared and give it to my developers. For the site I was the client of, the junior developers didn't work on it. And I don't blame them if they didn't because I didn't provide all of the content for the child pages.</p>

                        <p>Now that I have worked on a site with a tean, I feel more confident, not completely, in working on real-world projects. I didn't really engage with the all of my project partners, and communication with everyone is required for success in the real-world. I will need more practice if I am to be confident in working on a real-world project.</p>
