                        <p>This was the most difficult excercise. Already being given the images and a basic html, I had to build the html and css from the ground up and get it to match the prompt as close as possible.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The most difficult part of this excercise was trying to get the sizing of the title image and the position of title setup in front of it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another very difficult part was the positioning of the elements of the main of the card. I had to use gap help seperate the elements and much padding at the bottom to compensate for that. If you don't already know, gap increases the height below over the next elements below.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I believe I was very true to the prompt.</p>

                        <p>This was a very simple excercise. I was given the objective to resize the images shown here. I was able to resize them from a max size of 34 mb to a minimum size of 28 kb.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The problem was that when opening the file, it took about 5 to 10 seconds for all of the images to load in, and we were given the reasource of <i><a href="https://www.photopea.com" target="_blank">photopea.com</a></i> to resize them.</p>

                        <p>This excercise wasn't too difficult. I had to use CSS to create shapes and position them within an area to recreate a given image or prompt for each activity given.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The most difficult activity for me was Activity 5. I had to find a way to get text and a green square to exist in the same area without overlaying one over the other. I was able to accomplish this by setting a div container and plain text, being placed outside of an element, on the same level inside a div container.</p>

                        <p>Grid Flags was very simple. I had to use CSS to place colored divs in grids to create flags. The most difficult part of this excersice was the crosses in the Denmark and Finland flags.</p>

I used <i><a href="https://gemini.google.com/app" target="_blank">Google Gemini</a></i> to have it be stylized in the theme of Halloween. I didn't ask too much for stylization and I couldn't decide if to have the background be a gradient of moonglow green-blue to black, or just black. I ended up not using a gradient.</p>

                        <p>This assignment was really easy. We had to create and stylize a table and form, and we didn't need to make the form functional. I used <i><a href="https://gemini.google.com/app" target="_blank">Google Gemini</a></i> to create a table in the style of the page and a form to go with it. To do so, I inputed a screenshot of the page and asked it to give me a simple table and form to go with it.</p>

                        <p>I had to put together this apostles spotlight from scratch and, at the time, I had just learned about grid in CSS.
